                    It is hereby agreed between Tribecar and the Hirer as follows:


                    HIRER COVENANTS
                    The Hirer and the Authorised Driver(s) (as defined in Clause 1(e)) MUST be between 18 â€“ 65 years old
                    and shall be either:-
                    an individual holding an employment pass with at least 6 months of validity, holding on to a valid
                    International Driving License (printed in romanised characters) with a valid credit card, OR
                    a Singaporean holding a valid Singapore Driving Licence for it's classification of vehicles (class
                    2B/2A/2/3A/3) with a valid debit or credit card.
                    The Hirer will be required to have at least 2 years of driving experience. In the event that the
                    Hirer has less than 2 years of driving experience, the Hirer shall be subject to additional
                    membership approval requirements and/or additional terms and conditions relating to the use of the
                    Services.

                    Under the applicable traffic laws in Singapore, if the Hirer is non-Singaporean, he may only use his
                    International Driving Licence for up to 1 year (from the time of his arrival) in Singapore, after
                    which he must obtain a Singapore Driving Licence. For insurance purposes, if a Hirer has both an
                    International Driving Licence and a Singapore Driving Licence, we will only count the years of
                    driving experience from the date of issue of the Singapore Driving Licence.

                    If the Hirer is younger than 23 years old AND/OR has less than 2 years driving experience (as
                    indicated on their Singapore driving licence), he shall also be classified as a "New Driver(s)" and
                    be subject to the additional membership approval requirements and/or such additional terms and
                    conditions as may be set out by Tribecar in this Agreement.
                    In the event where the Hirer possesses more than 1 class of driving licence, the Hirer will be
                    classified as a New Driver if one of the driving licences had been obtained for less than 2 years.
                    If the Hirer wishes to forgo the New Driver status for the above scenario, the Hirer should sign-up
                    manually to only register the driving licence obtained for more than 2 years instead of signing up
                    using SingPass to avoid being classified as a New Driver.
                    The Hirer is to provide a coloured scanned copy of his/her original identity card, driving license
                    and proof of residence upon registration. The hirer may also be requested to complete a video
                    conference with the employees of Tribecar to verify the details of the hirer. The Hirer also may be
                    requested to provide a Selfie of themselves together with their identification document. A
                    screenshot will be saved to keep a record of such video conference and/or Selfie. The Hirer may also
                    be requested to submit a Selfie in front of the vehicle before the booking to prove the driver is
                    the Hirer.
                    The Hirer and/or the Authorised Driver(s) must not be an individual who is or has been a declared
                    (or undeclared or discharged or undischarged) bankrupt and/or an individual who is being charged for
                    bankruptcy. If the Hirer and/or the Authorised Driver(s) attempts to (i) register for a membership
                    with Tribecar, (ii) tries to maintain a suspended/active membership with Tribecar, and/or (iii)
                    continues to use the Services provided by Tribecar, he or she will be reported to relevant
                    authorities for attempting or actively maintaining a contractual relationship without prior approval
                    by the relevant authorities. Additionally, if an individual who has a membership with Tribecar is
                    subsequently found to be a declared (or undeclared or discharged or undischarged) bankrupt, Tribecar
                    shall be entitled to unilaterally, without notification, terminate the relationship and/or any
                    agreement with the aforesaid Hirer, including the right to forfeit any amount due to the Hirer which
                    is held by Tribecar. For avoidance of doubt, Tribecar does not permit or accept any Hirer that is or
                    has been a declared/undeclared/discharged/undischarged bankrupt. Furthermore, if the
                    Hirer/Authorised Driver/individual operates Tribecar's vehicles (the "Vehicles" and each, a
                    "Vehicle") (with or without Tribecar's permission), he/she shall not be entitled to any insurance
                    coverage whatsoever.
                    The Hirer may add up to 2 additional named drivers ("Authorised Drivers") for his booking if he
                    checks on "Additional Driver (s)" under the optional add-ons before completion of the booking and
                    agrees to pay an additional surcharge as listed. The addition of such Authorised Drivers as a named
                    driver of the Vehicle shall be subject to Tribecarâ€™s sole and absolute discretion. Authorised
                    Drivers must be with the Account Holder during the booking at all times for the insurance to be
                    valid. Authorised Drivers are not allowed to drive the rented vehicle without the Account Holder's
                    presence.
                    The Hirer agrees not to:
                    make or permit to be made any repairs or adjustments to be made to the Vehicle without prior
                    immediate notification to Tribecar of the extent of the damages to the Vehicle and approval by
                    Tribecar for ratification;
                    remove or deface any identification marks or plates affixed to the Vehicle;
                    fit any accessories to or to modify the Vehicle in any way without the consent of Tribecar; and
                    use or permit the Vehicle to be used or operated in a manner contrary to the applicable laws in
                    Singapore.
                    If the Hirer is a New Driver, the Hirer hereby acknowledges and agrees that he/she will be subject
                    to the following additional terms and conditions:-
                    For the period which the Hirer remains a New Driver, the Hirer shall only be permitted to make
                    bookings and/or drive Vehicles as permitted and listed/made available for use by New Drivers. For
                    the avoidance of doubt, in relation to the use of the Services while the hirer remains a New Driver,
                    the Hirer shall not be permitted to make bookings and/or drive any other classes of Vehicles which
                    are not expressly permitted by Tribecar
                    The Hirer is wholly responsible for the security of his membership and account with Tribecar. The
                    Hirer must use a strong password for his login account and guard the use of his account against
                    unauthorised usage. As it is possible to gain access to Hirer's Tribecar membership or account
                    through the Hirer's email or computing device such as smartphone, the Hirer must also exercise
                    necessary care to protect these access points against unauthorised access and usage as well. If
                    Tribecar suffers a loss due to the Hirer's action or inaction to guard the use of his account by
                    unauthorized users for any and all reasons, the Hirer shall be wholly responsible for the losses
                    suffered by Tribecar. If the Hirer suspects his account is compromised, he must inform Tribecar
                    immediately but such notice do not absolve Hirer's responsible to any and all losses of Tribecar.
                    Tribecar explicitly disallows the sale/subsale/resale (or "Resale" in general) of the Hirer's
                    Tribecar membership. Resale is explicitly not permitted and insurance coverage is not provided for
                    all unauthorised drivers and users. Commercially, the Hirer agrees that resale for profit,
                    convenience or gains is not permitted by Tribecar. In the event that the Hirer perform a (partial or
                    whole) resale of membership or account, Tribecar has the right to recover all losses (such as
                    damages and accidents cost) and all gains (such as profit from subletting and loss of membership
                    fees) from the Hirer and doing so at his costs (such as legal fees and administrative costs).

                    USE OF VEHICLE
                    The Hirer may use the Vehicle for business, social, domestic and leisure purposes. However, the
                    Hirer agrees that the Vehicle shall not be used, and the Hirer shall not permit the Vehicle to be
                    used for the following purposes:
                    for any purposes for which the Vehicle is not expressly designed for, as shall be determined at
                    Tribecar's sole and absolute discretion (e.g. as a crash test car);
                    for any driving tuition, sub-leasing, towing, racing, pace-making;
                    for competing in any form of motor sport; or
                    for any illegal purposes whatsoever. For instance, transportation of of illegal goods and cargo such
                    as cigarettes, undeclared goods, human trafficking are not permitted by Tribecar.
                    Whilst a Vehicle is in the Hirer's possession, the Hirer acknowledges and agrees that he/she will be
                    held fully responsible for any, but not limited to, vehicular accident, damages, lose, fire or theft
                    caused to that Vehicle.
                    The Hirer shall be responsible for the fuel, Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) and parking charges and
                    Traffic fines arising from the use of the Vehicle provided by Tribecar during the Rental Period
                    (defined in Clause 2(n)).
                    The Hirer acknowledges and agrees that the Vehicles are strictly for use in SINGAPORE AND WEST
                    MALAYSIA (i.e. Peninsular Malaysia). For the avoidance of doubt, reference to West Malaysia for the
                    purposes of this Clause 2, shall refer to the following states in Malaysia [Kuala Lumpur, Johor
                    Bahru, Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, Putrajaya, Selangor, Pahang (up to {the latitude of} Kuantan but
                    not any higher or further)]. The Hirer acknowledges and agrees that any unauthorised use of the
                    Vehicles in other countries and/or other authorised parts of Malaysia will result in the suspension
                    of membership.
                    The Hirer acknowledges and agrees that smoking (or vaping or electronic cigarette) in the Vehicles
                    and/or bring pets onboard shall NOT be allowed in the Vehicles. The Hirer hereby acknowledges and
                    agrees to bear all the costs and expenses that will be incurred for engaging professional services
                    for the removal of any resultant stain in the Vehicle which is attributable to any of restricted
                    acts of the Hirer as set out in this Clause 2(e).
                    If the Hirer causes any inconvenience to other hirers and/or Tribecar, and/or damage to Tribecar's
                    cars or other vehicles or properties, and/or fines/charges/penalties/fees which are attributable to
                    the Hirer's action, the Hirer shall be liable and shall indemnify and/or reimburse Tribecar for any
                    and all claims (including third party claims), actions, proceedings, demands, liabilities, losses,
                    damages, costs (including legal costs on an indemnity basis) and expenses of whatever nature,
                    arising directly out of or in connection the acts or omissions of the Hirer.
                    Without the prior written consent of Tribecar, the Hirer shall not make or permit to be made any
                    mechanical or other modifications, any alterations, additions, or repairs to the Vehicle, or fit any
                    towing equipment or other accessories or non-standard tyres. In the event of any such modification,
                    alteration, addition or repair (whether with or without the consent of Tribecar), any additional or
                    modified part of the Vehicle shall be deemed to become part of the Vehicle and shall belong to
                    Tribecar, without prejudice to any rights or remedies accruing to Tribecar under this Agreement.
                    The Hirer shall not:
                    Remove or interfere with any identification marks or plates affixed to the Vehicle;
                    deface the paintwork or bodywork of the Vehicle or add or erect any painting, sign-writing,
                    lettering or advertising to or on the Vehicle, or attempt to do so or permit the same to be done;
                    use or permit the Vehicle to be used or operated in a manner contrary to any law or regulation of
                    Singapore; or
                    sell, assign, mortgage, let on hire or otherwise dispose of or part with possession or control of
                    the Vehicle or assign its rights under this Agreement or attempt to do so. In the event that the
                    Hirer loses possession or control of the Vehicle, the Hirer shall take all necessary steps at the
                    Hirer's own expense to recover possession and control of the Vehicle for such reasonable duration as
                    Tribecar may at its sole and absolute discretion determine
                    The Hirer shall return the Vehicle to Tribecar together with all tyres, tools, accessories and
                    equipment, in as good order and condition (reasonable wear and tear excepted) as the state of the
                    Vehicle was upon collection by the Hirer from Tribecar.
                    The Hirer shall ensure that the Vehicle shall not at any time during the Rental Period be driven by
                    any person other than by the Hirer or an Authorised Driver and shall procure that the Authorised
                    Driver complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement as if an original party hereto. The
                    Hirer hereby acknowledges and agrees that it shall be solely responsible to Tribecar for any
                    non-compliance by the Authorised Driver with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and that the
                    Hirer shall indemnify Tribecar for any and all claims (including third party claims), actions,
                    proceedings, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, costs (including legal costs on an indemnity
                    basis) and expenses of whatever nature, arising directly out of or in connection the acts or
                    omissions of the Authorised Driver.
                    The Hirer shall bear all costs of repair and rectification for any damage to the Vehicle resulting
                    from negligence or improper use of the Vehicle by the Hirer or Authorised Driver.
                    In the event of any breach of this Agreement by the Hirer or Authorised Driver, the Hirer shall pay
                    Tribecar on demand all losses and damages suffered by Tribecar (including all legal costs and
                    expenses incurred for and on behalf of Tribecar for the enforcement of any provision in this
                    Agreement, on a full indemnity basis) in connection with such breach, including any loss or damage
                    arising from the loss of use or loss of or damage to the Vehicle for any reason whatsoever.
                    The Hirer shall indemnify Tribecar in full against any and all claims, actions, proceedings,
                    damages, losses, liabilities (including any loss of revenue, loss of profits or indirect damages),
                    costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses on a full indemnity basis) that may be brought
                    against, suffered or incurred by Tribecar in connection with any use of the Vehicle, which are not
                    otherwise covered by the insurance policy(ies) taken out by Tribecar.
                    The Hirer is only authorised to use the Vehicle during the period of his/her (fully paid for)
                    reservation (in accordance with Clause 3) ("Rental Period"). This use may be reasonably extended by
                    a booking extension made via the Website. If the Hirer continues to use/operate the vehicle beyond
                    the end of his/her reservation, he/she shall be charged late fees (in accordance with the Penalty
                    Charges pursuant to Clause 11). However, should the use/operation of the vehicle extend beyond the
                    end of the reservation by 2 hours or more, the use/operation of the vehicle by the Hirer shall no
                    longer be authorised or permitted by Tribecar. In which case, insurance coverage and any potential
                    insurance claims due to accidents during this unauthorised/unpermitted use will be denied.
                    Furthermore, Tribecar may at its sole and absolute discretion report such unauthorised/unpermitted
                    use/operation of the vehicle to the police as a theft of Tribecar's Vehicle.
                    The Hirer use of the "End Trip" function shall mark the end of his/her reservation. The specific
                    timing of the "End Trip" function may be set before or after the actual end of the Hirer's
                    reservation. Once the "End Trip" function is used, the Hirer shall no longer be authorised/permitted
                    to use/operate the Vehicle (unless separate permission if sought by the Hirer and given by
                    Tribecar).
                    Due to recent availability of the option for multi-day rental in Tribecar's system, Tribecar may be
                    required to perform scheduled car washes differently, at its convenience. Accordingly, if the
                    Hirer's rented Vehicle is found to be parked at the designated parking lot ("Pick Up Location")
                    during a Hirer's Rental Period, the Hirer hereby acknowledges and agrees that he/she shall be deemed
                    to have pre-authorised Tribecar to clean the exterior the Vehicle and, if time permits, clean the
                    interior of the relevant Vehicle
                    The Vehicle and its equipment within or part of it (e.g. In-Car Camera, Tribecar Onboard Computer,
                    USB Charger, etc) may be protected with anti-tampering device and systems (e.g. anti-tampering
                    stickers). If damaged by the direct/indirect action of the Hirer, the Hirer may be liable for
                    penalties, damages and fines as may be reasonably determined by Tribecar at its discretion. At the
                    discretion of Tribecar, legal action may be sought against the Hirer in protecting the physical
                    properties and intellectual properties of Tribecar. Furthermore, if the tampering leads to removal
                    of critical information, e.g. removal of storage/memory for in-car memory, the Hirer's account will
                    be suspended (possibly termination as well, as determined solely by Tribecar), all future booking
                    removed without refund, and all insurance coverage (for past, present or future bookings) provided
                    by Tribecar to the Hirer will be immediately revoked.
                    Tribecar takes a very strong stance against Hirers that sublets Tribecar's Vehicles. Subletting is
                    explicitly not permitted and insurance coverage is not provided for all unauthorised drivers and
                    users. Under the Traffic Law, both the Hirer and the unauthorised driver will be subjected to fines
                    and penalties. Commercially, the Hirer agrees that subletting for profit, convenience or gains is
                    not permitted by Tribecar. In the event that the Hirer perform subletting or resale, Tribecar has
                    the right to recover all losses (such as damages and accidents cost) and all gains (such as profit
                    from subletting and loss of membership fees) from the Hirer and doing so at his costs (such as legal
                    fees and administrative costs).
                    Tribecar shall not be held liable for any items lost or misplaced by the Hirer. All items left
                    behind - such as Lost and Found items - by the Hirer will be disposed / donated / auctioned off
                    after 30 calendar days with no compensation or reimbursement to the Hirer.

                    DUTIES OF THE HIRER DURING RENTAL PERIOD
                    The Hirer shall take proper care of his/her rented Vehicle and drive the Vehicle in observation of
                    all traffic laws and regulations and in the event of any breach thereof, the Hirer shall pay all
                    fines and penalties which may be incurred, and answer all traffic summonses, including all notices
                    and inquiries in connection therewith. In particular, the Hirer shall ensure that during the
                    relevant Rental Period, the Vehicle:

                    (a) shall not be overloaded;
                    (b) has sufficient fuel, water and tire pressure at all times; and
                    (c) is properly parked and locked when not in use, and at the end of the Rental Period.
                    The Hirer shall further be responsible for fuel, and all Electronic Road Pricing charges, parking
                    charges, and toll fees arising from the use of the Vehicle and pay off all traffic summonses,
                    including all notices and inquiries in connection therewith via the AXS after 5 working days from
                    the relevant Rental by the Hirer. If any traffic summons, including all notices and inquiries are
                    sent to Tribecar, Tribecar will charge an administrative charge of S$10.80 deductible via the
                    Hirer's e-wallet with Tribecar. For the purposes of this Agreement, "e-wallet" shall refer to the
                    Hirer's digital wallet with Tribecar used for transactions made on the Website.

                    When hiring Car Club by Tribecar category vehicles(Car Club Prime MPV (Fuel-Included), Car Club
                    Prime Sedan (Fuel-Included), Car Club Select MPV (Fuel-Included), Car Club Select SUV
                    (Fuel-Included) and Car Club Select Sedan (Fuel-Included)), the Hirer shall ensure sufficient fuel
                    (more than Â¼ tank) upon return or at the end of the trip.

                    The Hirer shall be required to comply with all the instructions provided by Tribecar (whether on an
                    ad hoc basis or otherwise), including instructions provided by the employees or appointed personnel
                    of Tribecar. Such instructions shall include without limitation to instructions from Tribecar to
                    request that the Hirer ceases any actions that may endanger or damage the Vehicles or such other
                    assets or property within the purview of Tribecar. In the event where the Hirer fails to comply with
                    any instruction provided by Tribecar, Tribecar shall be entitled to fine the Hirer a minimum penalty
                    of S$108.00 for administration or such additional amount as Tribecar may reasonably stipulate
                    depending on the quantum of the damages, costs and expenses incurred by Tribecar as a result of the
                    Hirerâ€™s non-compliance with Tribecarâ€™s instructions. In the event of such non-compliance by the
                    Hirer, Tribecar may also stipulate that the use of the Vehicle (including valid bookings) will be
                    forfeited and withdrawn with no reimbursement to the Hirer.

                    In order to combat insurance fraud and unauthorised usage of Tribecar Vehicles, the Hirer may be
                    requested to perform on demand Hirer verification by Tribecar. This may involve the Hirer taking a
                    Selfie in front of the Vehicle before, during and/or after the booking. If the Hirer fails to do as
                    instructed, the Hirer's account may be suspended for investigation and the Hirer is considered to
                    have failed to comply with Tribecar instructions.


                    VEHICLE RESERVATION / DEPOSIT / PAYMENT
                    The Hirer hereby acknowledges and agrees that:

                    Any reservation of a Vehicle by the Hirer shall be made in advance of the Hirer's intended Rental
                    Period ("Rental").
                    The Hirer shall only be entitled to reserve one (1) Vehicle within the same date and time period.
                    The priority for the use of a Vehicle shall be on a first reserved, first served basis.
                    The Hirer shall upon registration of an account with Tribecar pay to Tribecar the following amounts
                    as security:-.
                    a deposit of S$100.00 (payment to be by way of credit/debit card) for Singapore Citizen;
                    a deposit of S$500.00 (S$100.00 payment by way of credit/debit card and $400.00 by local bank
                    transfer only) for a Hirer who is not a Singapore citizen (i.e. an individual holding an employment
                    pass with at least 6 months of validity);
                    In relation to a New Driver who has previously paid the additional deposit of S$100.00 to Tribecar,
                    in the event that such Hirer is no longer considered to be a New Driver (as determined by Tribecar)
                    at the point of his/her termination of this Agreement and/or his/her account with Tribecar, Tribecar
                    shall convert such additional deposit into credits amounting to S$100.00 in the Hirerâ€™s e-wallet.
                    Similarly, if the Hirer has signed up as a New Driver under Singpass registration with more than 1
                    class of driving licence and decided to forgone one of his/her class, Tribecar shall convert such
                    additional deposit into credits amounting to S$100.00 in the Hirerâ€™s e-wallet. In the event that the

                    booking.
                    All reimbursements, refunds, compensations, adjustments by Tribecar to the Hirer shall be paid out

                    Tribecar reserves the right to cancel all future bookings if the Hirer's e-wallet will run into
                    negative balance as a result of such future bookings.
                    In the event where there are no future bookings to offset the negative balance, membership will be
                    suspended until such date where the Hirer has topped up his/her e-wallet such that his/her e-wallet
                    no longer has a negative balance.
                    In the event of a negative e-wallet balance without future bookings and the balance stays negative

                    additional admin fee (according to our Payment Gateway Fee; see 4L) at a minimum of $1, to zero the

                    rental fee due and owing from the Hirer to Tribecar.
                    The Hirer's account will be automatically closed after the account remains inactive for a period of
                    24 consecutive months. For the avoidance of doubt, the first dormancy check will be carried out in
                    February 2019. A Hirer (or the Hirer's e-Wallet) is considered inactive if he/she has not made a
                    booking for the last twenty-four (24) consecutive calendar months. To be able to make a booking, the
                    Hirer shall ensure that his/her e-Wallet does not have a negative balance. After making a booking,
                    the Hirer's account will be deemed to be active for another twenty-four (24) months.
                    Tribecar do not guarantee the specific make or model of the vehicle that is reserved by the Hirer.
                    The vehicle that is available on pickup may differ from the vehicle reserved by the hirer but will
                    be similar in category, class, cost, sitting capacity or size. Tribecar shall make the sole
                    determination in what constitutes a similar vehicle.
                    Rental of cars by the hirers can be for both leisure and commercial usage. For Grab purposes, Hirers
                    are advised to download and check the validity of the documents required (Log card (Vehicle
                    Registration Details), Certificate of Insurance, PHV Decal) at least 1 day in advance and upload
                    them to Grab's App for updating of the car plate. Bookings will not be refunded by Tribecar for any
                    delay in uploading or approval from any ride-hailing companies.
                    Some Vehicles on the Tribecar platform may not be available for use for ride-hailing purposes. These
                    Vehicles do not have the Private Hire decal and do not have the appropriate Z10 insurance (only
                    R10). Specifically, the Opel Corsa (Standard Sedan), Opel Crossland (Standard SUV), COE cars and all
                    Vehicles under the Super Economy Category and Mercedez-Benz.

                    not listed under the original condition of the Vehicle as set out in the Vehicle Checklist, before
                    leaving the designated parking lot which the Vehicle had been parked at the start of the Rental
                    Period. If no report is made by the Hirer, the Hirer acknowledges and agrees that the prevailing
                    condition of the Vehicle will be deemed to be aligned with previous condition as it was handed over.
                    To make a report to Tribecar, the Hirer shall to take such photos of the Vehicle as is necessary to
                    reflect any defects and/or discrepancies in the prevailing condition of the Vehicle vis-a-vis the
                    original condition of the Vehicle and send such photos as evidence of such defects or discrepancies
                    to support@tribecar.com before leaving the designated parking lot which the Vehicle had been parked
                    at the start of the Rental Period.
                    The Hirer shall be required to check if fuel light of the Vehicle lights up UPON IGNITION of the
                    Vehicle's engine and the Hirer shall report any issues with the starting of the Vehicle with
                    photographic evidence of fuel light within 15 minutes upon collection of the Vehicle.
                    The Hirer shall be required to check for the presence of the fuel card in Car Club by Tribecar
                    vehicles and the hirer shall report the issue to Tribecar if the fuel card is found to be missing.
                    If the hirer is found to fail to report the missing fuel card, the hirer will be subjected to a
                    $108.00 fuel card replacement fee.
                    The Hirer's Rental will start exactly at the start of the relevant Rental Period which the Hirer had
                    booked and not based on the time which the Vehicle is unlocked by the Hirer.
                    Any early collection of the Vehicle up to thirty (30) minutes prior to start time of the Hirer's
                    Rental Period without any additional costs will be permitted, but will not be guaranteed and shall
                    be subject to the availability of the relevant Vehicle, as shall be determined by Tribecar at its
                    discretion.
                    At start of the Rental Period or whilst the Hirer is in the midst of collecting the Vehicle, if the
                    Hirer does not confirm that there is any damage to the Vehicle or issues with the Hirer's Rental via
                    the Website (or via official support channels such as email), the Hirer acknowledges and agrees that
                    Tribecar shall be entitled to presume that there is no damage to the Vehicle or issues with the
                    Hirer's booking. This is particularly relevant to situations where the Hirer fails to complete the
                    Start Trip process on the Website properly or otherwise.
                    The Hirerâ€™s Rental shall be considered to have been fulfilled/used in full upon the conclusion of
                    the Hirerâ€™s Rental Period. Therefore, even if the Hirer had not utilised the Vehicle during the
                    relevant Rental Period, OR, if he/she had utilised the Vehicle for a fraction of the Rental Period,
                    there shall be no refund or partial refund of the any portion of the fees paid by the Hirer for the
                    relevant Rental.
                    If the Hirer collects the car later than start of the Rental Period and due to breakdown of the
                    Vehicle he is not able to use the Vehicle, he shall be entitled for the refund of the balance of the
                    booking via the e-Wallet. This is of particular importance in cases where Hirers books the Vehicle
                    for extended period of time and significant amount of time has lapsed before he/she attempts to
                    collect the Vehicle.
                    If the Hirer is unable to Start Trip for any reason (e.g. due to low Vehicle battery), the Hirer
                    must call in to the emergency hotline for assistance and reporting. If the Hirer fails to call in
                    and only emailed in of such occurrence, the Hirer may not be able to obtain a partial or a full
                    refund of his booking due to the delay / non-call reporting. The Tribecar staff will endeavour to
                    provide a replacement Vehicle for such issue.

                    VEHICLE RETURN
                    At the end of the Hirer's Rental Period, as the Hirer is in the process of returning the relevant
                    Vehicle:

                    The Hirer shall be required to return the Vehicle in the same condition as it was provided to Hirer
                    at the start of the Rental and the Hirer shall be responsible for any repair or refurbishment costs
                    for any new defects found to be caused by Hirer. The aforementioned costs shall be added to the
                    costs of the Hirer's Rental, subject to conditions.
                    The Hirer shall be required to refuel the Vehicle using unleaded RON 95 / 98 or V Power. For
                    Vehicles in the Standard or Premium categories, the Hirer is required to refuel such Vehicles using
                    unleaded RON 95 and above (RON 98 or V Power). For Vehicles that uses Diesel, the Hirer shall be
                    required to refuel such Vehicles using Diesel (Euro5 or better).
                    In the event that the Hirer were to be found to have returned a Vehicle in a condition whereby the
                    fuel light lights up upon the subsequent ignition of the Vehicle's engine, he/she hereby
                    acknowledges that Tribecar shall be entitled to deduct S$50.00 from his/her e-wallet as penalty for
                    his/her failure in refuelling the Vehicle. The Hirer may provide any form/type of document (for
                    example: photos, videos, receipts, timestamps) as evidence to appeal for the charge/s.
                    For Vehicles that is on the full tank return policy, if the Hirer returns the Vehicle with less than
                    a full tank of fuel, Tribecar may at its sole and absolute discretion levy a "Fuel Top-up Charge",
                    being (i) a sum of $37.80 in fuel fees per 1/8th of the tank or part thereof, or (ii) such amount of
                    fuel fees per 1/8th of the tank or part thereof, as shall be determined based on the following
                    formula:-
                    Maximum Fuel Tank Capacity
                    8 x Prevailing Fuel Rate (S$ 11) x2

                    For the purposes of this Agreement:-
                    "Maximum Fuel Tank Capacity" shall refer to the maximum capacity of the relevant Vehicleâ€™s fuel
                    tank.
                    "Prevailing Fuel Rate" shall refer to the prevailing per litre price of the petrol required for a
                    certain Vehicle.

                    For Car Club by Tribecar category vehicles, if the hirer returns the vehicle with less than Â¼ tank
                    of fuel, the hirer will be subjected to a $37.80 "Fuel Top-up Charge".
                    For electric vehicles, if the hirer returns with a charge at or below 50%, the Tribecar reserved
                    fuel penalty applies. If the hirer returns with a percentage of less than 15% and the vehicle breaks
                    down, the hirer will be charged $64.80 for 2-way towing to the charging station and an extra $19.44
                    for time charge (for traveling time and charging time of 30 minutes from 30 - 70%).
                    The Hirer shall be required to end the Rental on or prior to the end of the Rental Period which was
                    booked by the Hirer and the Hirer shall be required to return the Vehicle to its designated parking
                    lot before the end of the Hirer's Rental Period. The Rental shall only be deemed to have ended: (i)
                    at the end of the Hirerâ€™s Rental Period, or (ii) after the Hirer has clicked on "End Trip" button on
                    the Website, whichever is later.
                    The Hirer hereby acknowledges and agrees that late return penalties will be imposed by Tribecar if
                    the Hirer does not end his/her Rental successfully prior to the end of his/her Rental Period.
                    Accordingly, the Hirer should allocate approximately 10 - 15 minutes in advance to return the
                    Vehicle to its designated parking lot and end the Rental before the conclusion of the Rental Period
                    that he/she had booked.
                    For each fifteen (15) minute block (or part thereof) which the Hirer has returned the Vehicle late,
                    the Hirer acknowledges and agrees that he/she will incur a late return penalty of S$10.80 (or the
                    relevant peak or festive rate for that hour, whichever is higher). The subsequent Hirer of the
                    relevant Vehicle (if affected by the late return of the Vehicle) will be rewarded with S$5.40 (or
                    50% of the late fees paid by the previous hirer, whichever is higher) in credits as compensation.
                    Compensation is limited to the first hour of late fees.
                    Tribecar will not be responsible for loss of or damage to the Hirer's personal belongings and the
                    contents therein (including any valuables, even if Tribecar has been advised on such contents)
                    during the storage of such personal belongings in the Vehicle or while removing such personal
                    belongings from the Vehicle and the Hirer hereby agrees to release Tribecar from any liability in
                    respect thereof.
                    The Hirer shall return the Vehicle to the Pick Up Location upon the termination of this Agreement
                    (i.e. when the Hirer cancels his/her account with Tribecar). In the event where the Hirer fails to
                    return the Vehicle to the Pick Up Location (i) when the Hirer cancels his/her account with Tribecar,
                    or (ii) after a 2 hours period after the end of his/her Rental Period (for any reason
                    whatsoever),Tribecar shall be entitled to repossess the Vehicle at the Hirer's expense at any time
                    without giving him prior notice and the Hirer hereby irrevocably authorizes Tribecar or its
                    representatives to enter into any premises where the Vehicle is kept to repossess the same without
                    being liable to any action or proceeding at the suit of the Hirer or any person(s) claiming under or
                    through him. The steps that Tribecar may take to repossess the Vehicle include, but are not limited
                    to, entering the Vehicle with its spare key, towing the Vehicle, and/or relying on third party
                    vehicle repossession services.
                    In the event that the Vehicle is repossessed by Tribecar under this Agreement:
                    The Parties hereby agree that Tribecar will not be liable for the loss of any personal belongings of
                    the Hirer in the course of repossession; and
                    The Hirer will remain liable for any damage to the Vehicle at the point of repossession.
                    At the end of the booking or during the return of the car, if the Hirer does not confirm that there
                    are damages on the car or issues with the Hirer's Rental booking via the Website (or via official
                    support channels such as email), the Hirer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Tribecar shall be
                    entitled to presume that the Hirer will be responsible to any damages found later on the car and
                    that the Hirer will be responsible for issues with the Hirer's Rental booking. This is particularly
                    relevant to situations where the Hirer fails to complete the End Trip process on the Website
                    properly or otherwise.
                    The Hirer must ensure the Vehicle (e.g. cars, motorcycles) is properly locked and secured after
                    Ending Trip. If it is not secured, the Hirer must make a report of it within 5 minutes of the
                    incident by Email or Call. If the Vehicle is misused or stolen, the Hirer that did not secure the
                    Vehicle may be liable for damages suffered by Tribecar.
                    The Hirer must exercise every caution when returning the vehicle during End Trip so that the next
                    customer or Tribecar or vendor may retrieve the Vehicle in the condition that is the same as it was
                    when the Hirer Started Trip. For clarity, the Vehicle must not be damaged or changed due to the
                    final parking position of the Hirer. The Hirer agrees to return the Vehicle to the designated
                    parking position (as indicated by the Tribecar system) unless instructed by the Tribecar. It is
                    wholly the responsibility of the hirer to ensure that the final parking position to be free of
                    hazards (such as Fire, Flood and Falling Risks) and be free of compliance issues from the government
                    (such as Breaching Parking Regulations, Breaching Traffic Act and Town Council Acts). If the Hirer
                    fail to exercise caution in returning the Vehicle, the Hirer may be liable for damages caused by
                    his/her improper choice of parking position. For example, Hirer choosing to park near a pile of
                    debris (designed parking location or otherwise) and the debris falls on to the Vehicle. As another
                    example, Hirer choosing to park a Tribecar Motorcycle (designed parking location or otherwise)
                    beside a sinkhole.
                    If the Hirer neglects to End Trip and the Tribecar has to End Trip on behalf of the Hirer, a service
                    fee of $10.80 (or 1 hour of the peak hour rate, whichever is higher), will be levied to the Hirer.
                    Hirers may only use the Tribecar system to End Trip to lock and secure the Vehicle. Hirers may not
                    use any other methods to secure the vehicle (e.g. using the car alarm remote, car central locking,
                    steering bar locks, etc.) when ending their Rental Period. If there are costs incurred to restore
                    the use of the vehicle (e.g. requiring the use of spare key to unlock the Vehicle by a Tribecar
                    staff), said cost will be levied on the hirer that did not comply.
                    With the introduction of the item retrieval function, Hirers may gain access to the Vehicle after
                    the Trip has ended. Thus, the validity of the previously uploaded End Trip photos may be affected.
                    Customers are encouraged to resend their ETP if they so prefer. Also, Hirers are not allowed to
                    operate or drive the Vehicle after regaining access to the Vehicle while using this function.
                    Additional administrative fees may apply if the Hirer is in breach of this clause.

                    BREAKDOWN
                    The Hirer acknowledges and agrees that in the event that a Vehicle has broken down, Tribecar will
                    endeavour to provide a replacement vehicle of similar class (in accordance to Clause 4(p)) to
                    replace the Vehicle and if Tribecar is unable to procure a replacement vehicle, all subsequent
                    confirmed bookings which are scheduled within the next 12 hours of the Vehicle breakdown may be
                    cancelled, and the affected Hirers whose confirmed bookings have been cancelled shall receive a full
                    refund of the rental fees in relation to such cancelled bookings.
                    The Hirer acknowledges and agrees that in the event that a Vehicle has broken down, Tribecar will
                    endeavour to provide a replacement vehicle to replace the Vehicle and if Tribecar is unable to
                    procure a replacement vehicle, all subsequent confirmed bookings which are scheduled within the next
                    12 hours of the Vehicle breakdown may be cancelled, and the affected Hirers whose confirmed bookings
                    have been cancelled shall receive a full refund of the rental fees in relation to such cancelled
                    bookings.
                    If the Vehicle that the Hirer rented is met with an accident, the Hirer shall be required to inform
                    Tribecar immediately. The Hirer acknowledges and agrees that he/she shall not make any repairs or
                    permit any repairs to be made to the Vehicle without Tribecar's approval. If the Hirer is found
                    towing and/or repairing the rented Vehicle at any workshop unauthorized by Tribecar, Tribecar shall
                    be entitled to impose such relevant penalty on the Hirer (in accordance with the Penalty Charges
                    pursuant to Clause 11).
                    The maintenance of the vehicle will be borne by Tribecar. Notwithstanding the above, the Hirer shall
                    be required to take note of the Vehicle's engine temperature, The Hirer hereby acknowledges and
                    agrees that the Hirer shall fully indemnify Tribecar and/or bear all the costs and expenses which
                    will be incurred to repair of the Vehicle in the event of any overheating of the Vehicle's engine
                    which is attributable to the Hirer's acts, omissions and/or negligence. If there are any issues with
                    the Vehicle due to wear and tear and/or a Vehicle breakdown, the Hirer shall report such issues to
                    Tribecar immediately and seek Tribecar's advice/permission before proceeding to fix such issues with
                    the Vehicle.
                    Tribecar shall provide 24-Hours breakdown and emergency service at no extra cost to the Hirer if the
                    Vehicle suffers a breakdown or is involved in an accident. To utilise Tribecar's breakdown and
                    emergency service, the Hirer will need to press the "Need Help" - Emergency Button on the Website
                    during their Rental to call Tribecar's contact center.
                    The Hirer acknowledges and agrees that the following scenarios would not constitute a breakdown of
                    the Vehicle (i) where the Vehicle's keys are locked inside the Vehicle, (ii) where the steering
                    wheel is locked, (iii) where a punctured tyres needs to be changed and (iv) where the stalling of
                    the Vehicle is caused by empty fuel tank. The Hirer hereby acknowledges and agrees to pay Tribecar
                    the relevant fees amounting to S$54.00 as and when the 24-hour breakdown and emergency service is
                    found to have been deployed by the Hirer for the aforesaid scenarios which are not deemed to
                    constitute a breakdown of the Vehicle.
                    The Hirer must ensure that the Vehicle has reasonable amount of fuel, engine oil, auto-transmission
                    oil, radiator water at all times. The Hirer acknowledges and agrees that his/her failure to perform
                    such checks may result in damage to the Vehicle and Tribecar reserves its right to demand for
                    compensation from the Hirer for any damage to the Vehicle which is attributable to the acts,
                    omission and/or negligence of the Hirer.
                    In the event that the Vehicle breaks down and is unable to move, hit on the 'Breakdown Button' on
                    Hirer's account page and a tow service will be engaged.
                    The Hirer acknowledges and agrees that he/she will be responsible for any damage, cost or expenses
                    relating to the breakdown of a Vehicle which is due to the Hirer act, omission and/or negligence
                    which results in the the wrong type of fuel being pumped into the Vehicle.
                    If the Hirer meets with an accident (e.g. collision with another car, causes damage to the hired
                    car, etc) and fails to report it within 24 hours to Tribecar's designated reporting center, his
                    purchased additional insurance product (e.g. CDW, PAI) will be automatically voided without a refund
                    The Hirerâ€™s account may be temporarily suspended pending the investigation outcome of the breakdown
                    or accident. For avoidance of doubt, the Hirer may not be provided access or means to make another
                    booking for another Vehicle.

                    The Parties acknowledge that the relevant owners of the Vehicles (i.e. Tribecar Partners who have

                    ^ Subjected to a minimum co-insurance charge of $540

                    In the event of an accident, the Hirers shall:
                    obtain vehicle registration numbers, names, NRIC and addresses, telephone number of the parties
                    involved and of witness;
                    not admit fault or liability;
                    not abandoning the Vehicle without adequate provision for safeguarding and securing the same;
                    notify Tribecar immediately;
                    make a police report if any party suffers injury; and
                    not make private settlement with any third party without permission of Tribecar.
                    If the Hirer fails to obtain the necessary information in clause 8(b), CDW will be voided
                    immediately regardless of status of purchase of the CDW. Additionally, Tribecar, the owners of the
                    hired Vehicle, and the insurer may exercise their right to repudiate any claims in their
                    professional capacity as they deem appropriate.
                    CDW or Collision Damage Waiver, may be offered to the Hirer as a means to reduce the Non-waivable
                    Excess collectable when the Hirer meets with an accident. The reduced Non-waivable Excess is listed
                    in table 8a. CDW does not apply for accidents when the vehicle is written off or treated as total
                    loss (e.g. beyond economical repair).
                    Tribecar may provide an exception to Hirer Covenant at Tribecar's discretion but insurance excess
                    per party per accident will be doubled.
                    The excess amount must be paid to Tribecar or its appointed representative, without demand, within
                    48 hours from the accident date/time regardless of which party is at fault. Tribecar will determine
                    at its sole discretion when to refund the collected excess amount if at all applicable.
                    PAI add-on is not available for New Drivers and certain Vehicles. You will be given the option to
                    purchase PAI if it is available for the Vehicle.
                    CDW add-on for the Super Economy category is only available for select Vehicles. You will be given
                    the option to purchase CDW if it is available for the Vehicle. Should you purchase CDW for the Super
                    Economy category, you must give us the first rights to negotiate private settlement with the third
                    party. If the private settlement is unsuccessful then can you file a claim with the insurer.
                    Insurance for Vehicles under the Super Economy DO NOT COVER UNNAMED DRIVERS. If you allow anyone to
                    drive the car without permission, you will NOT have insurance coverage whatsoever. The Vehicles are
                    also not permitted for use as PHV usage such as Grab or Gojek.
                    The Hirer must report any and all car accident (whether severe or minor), within 24 hours of its
                    occurrence. In the event that the Hirer fails to report an accident within the stipulated timeframe,
                    the relevant insurance company may repudiate the case and all claims will be reported directly
                    against Hirer regardless of whether CDW is purchased. Furthermore, the Hirer will be liable for all
                    repairs and losses for the hired Vehicle.
                    In order to perform the accident reporting, the Hirer must book the Vehicle involved in the accident
                    and travel to the reporting center with the said Vehicle for reporting. The driver that was driving
                    during the accident must also be present during the accident reporting. If for any reason the
                    Vehicle is not in operational condition, Tribecar will engage a towing service at the cost of the
                    Hirer to bring the Vehicle to the reporting center.
                    When an accident involving the Hirer occurs, regardless of own damage or 3rd party vehicle, the
                    Hirer pre-authorizes Tribecar to deduct the insurance excess amount (if any) from their credit card/
                    debit card/ e-wallet / bank account regardless of the insurance outcome. Tribecar will refund (if
                    any) the balance of insurance excess amount, less the cost of the accident, when the details of the
                    accident are finalized.
                    Insurance excess only covers the bodywork of the vehicle and Hirer will be liable for the loss of
                    use subject to duration required for repair.
                    Tribecar will not be responsible for any incidental costs, e.g. reimbursement of taxi fares etc, due
                    to vehicle breakdown / accident.
                    When there is an accident, the Hirer is required to pay for the Loss of Rental from the time of
                    accident (or from the end of the original booking, whichever is later) until the time the car is
                    repaired and returned to the designated parking location of the Vehicle.
                    All Hirer solely pre-authorises Tribecar and its vendor and the subcontractors of the vendors (the
                    Pre-authorised Parties), including but not limited to Roset Limousine Services Pte Ltd, to handle
                    and be in-charge of all personal accident injury claim arising from any accident involving the
                    Vehicle that was booked by the Hirer. The Hirer also instructs the Pre-authorised Parties to appoint
                    a solicitor(s) and instruct them as the Pre-authorised Parties deem fit to aid the Hirer in recovery
                    of all damages pertaining to the Hirer's personal accident injury claim and property damage claims.
                    The Hirer shall take note that in an event that a settlement cannot be established with the relevant
                    third parties of the accident, an accident claim may be escalated to court in which only one Writ of
                    Summons will be issued which consist of the Hirer's personal accident injuries claim and Hirer's
                    property damage claims. The hirer also agree to fully indemnify the Pre-authorised Parties that in
                    the event that Hirer breached the obligation as stated in this clause (e.g. appoints another party
                    to handle claims by the Hirer, sends Writ of Summons independently), and in said event the Hirer
                    shall bear all legal costs and expenses incurred and/or consequential losses to the Pre-authorised
                    Parties.
                    In case of write-off or total loss of vehicle (e.g. beyond economical repair), the Non-waivable
                    Excess for Tribecar's Vehicle (for cars, 1st Party or Own Damage) will be set to S$6,480. This
                    amount is not reducible by CDW, PAI or any additional product purchased on Tribecar.
                    Insurance coverage is voided and/or withdrawn immediately without notice if the Hirer or the
                    Authorised Driver/Rider performs or commits or aid in committing acts that are not covered or
                    permitted by Tribecar or its vehicle providers' insurers (as mentioned in 2a). This may include
                    drink-driving, racing, speeding, subletting, providing unauthorised driving tuition, transporting
                    illegal goods (such as cigarettes or human trafficking) and etc.. Without insurance coverage, the
                    hirer will not be able to file an insurance claim if an accident were to happen.
                    If the hirer fails to file and complete the necessary accident reporting (a valid filing receipt by
                    GIA must be obtained to signify successful reporting) or fails to make in full the insurance excess,
                    his or her insurance coverage may be denied.
                    Insurance coverage (specifically third party risks and liabilities, loss or theft to the Vehicle,
                    and damage to the Vehicle) are supplied solely by the providers or owners of the Vehicle. Tribecar
                    does not explicitly provide insurance coverage to the Hirer.

                    PERSONAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE
                    The Hirer hereby acknowledges and agrees that:-
                    In order to enjoy the benefits provided by the Personal Accident Insurance (PAI), the hirer must
                    have paid for this add-on during the creation of the Rental booking.
                    The Hirer must provide a police report in addition to the usual GIA report for all accidents
                    including personal injuries.
                    The Hirer must inform and come down to Tribecar's appointed workshop for all insurance claims.
                    The above PAI insurance plan covers both the Hirer and the Authorised Drivers up to 65 years old.
                    Claims reimbursement will be made within 60 days from date of document submission and the Hirer
                    hereby acknowledges and agrees that the payment of such claim reimbursement will be ultimately
                    subject to the approval of the relevant insurance provider.
                    The Hirer shall be responsible to provide the following documents to facilitate a claim under the
                    PAI:
                    Death Claim: Death certificate, autopsy report, coroner's findings
                    Permanent Disability Claim: Medical Report
                    Temporary Disability Claim: Medical leave certificates
                    Medical Expenses Claim:
                    Original medical bills & receipt
                    Copy of NRIC / Work Permit (if applicable)
                    A copy of inpatient discharge summary.
                    Any other documents/receipts that may be requested by the Insurer from time to time.
                    Motorcycles (or any two-wheeled) vehicles are explicitly excluded from Personal Accident Insurance
                    (PAI) plans.
                    For commercial vehicles, the driver is covered by PAI only when he/she is driving the vehicle. It
                    excludes injuries from loading, unloading, deliveries, etc.
                    Territorial limit of the coverage is anywhere in Singapore and West Malaysia in direct connection
                    with the use of the Vehicle whilst driving on the road.
                    Suppression of material facts or misstatements when filling a claim may lead to the claim being
                    denied.
                    Tribecar will undertake such reasonable endeavours to process and submit the Hirer's PAI claim to
                    the insurer but will NOT be held liable or responsible for any delays and claim rejection fully or
                    partially by the Insurer and thereby reserve their rights to discontinue or terminate this Insurance
                    scheme at any time without prior notice.

                    PARKING AND TRAFFIC OFFENSES
                    Should the Vehicle rented by the Hirer be involved in any traffic offence during the period, the
                    Hirer agrees to be liable for any issues with the vehicle that arise under the Hirer's care and
                    agree to pay all fines and any amount government or semi-government authorities shall levy or
                    impose.
                    The Hirer shall ensure that he/she has a valid driving license during Rental Period and that he/shes
                    complies with the Road Traffic Act. (Cap. 276).
                    If the Hirer fails to make payment for smart parking at gantry-less car parks, the Hirer will be
                    charged the parking amount together with an additional administrative fee of $21.60.

                    PRICING / CANCELLATION POLICY / PENALTY CHARGES
                    All rates are quoted in Singapore dollars and is inclusive of 8% GST (Goods and Services Tax) which
                    will be borne by the Hirer.
                    Rental is calculated on an hourly basis. The minimum Rental Period which a Hirer may book is one
                    hour.
                    Cost/fees/surcharges of the rental/booking shall follow the listed rates. However, bookings that
                    spans peak festive period or high demand period may carry a surcharge or have a different rate.
                    Furthermore, due to extensions/adjustments/cancellations/alterations, booking rates/charges may be
                    calculated differently. As such, the system and Tribecar's determination of the cost of the
                    rental/booking shall be final.
                    In cases where there is electronic pricing errors, e.g. when rental/prices/surcharges deviates and
                    is lower by more than 20% of usual rates/market rates, Tribecar shall have to right to cancel and
                    refund bookings made under erroneous rates and refuse to honour the erroneous rates without any
                    compensation. If the booking has commenced or has been completed before the discovery of the error,
                    Tribecar shall have the right to recover the difference in rental due to the error.
                    When the Hirer is liable to Tribecar for penalty charge(s), late fee(s), and/or any charges or fees
                    owed to Tribecar, the Hirer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Tribecar shall be authorised to
                    deduct such outstanding amounts due and owing to Tribecar from the Hirer's credit card/ debit card/
                    e-wallet/ bank account.
                    All disputes with regards to invoicing, pricing, rental, booking, membership, fees, charges,
                    penalties, contracts must be raised within 7 calendar days of issuance, delivery, communication by
                    Tribecar (whichever is earlier). Otherwise, the dispute request will not be entertained or reviewed.
                    (Until further notice, Auth Hold for Audi A3 is waived.) For certain classes of car categories (e.g.
                    Audi A3 in Premium Sedan and Mini Cooper in Special Drive), the Hirer will be requested to approve
                    an authorisation hold of S$200.00 by Tribecar. This authorisation hold will reduce the Hirers credit
                    card's credit limit but a charge will not be captured unless there is/are outstanding fee(s) due to
                    Tribecar. It may be held for the length of the Hirer's Rental Period or for 7 days, whichever
                    duration is longer. The Hirer may also be requested to re-do the authorisation if the authorisation
                    has lapsed. This authorisation charge is tied to the Hirer's account and may be used to offset any
                    charge(s) due to Tribecar for any booking/penalties/other charges. If the Hirer is unable to
                    complete the authorisation hold, there will be no refund or partial refund for the booking. This is
                    so even if the booking was utilized partially or not utilised at all.
                    If the previous Hirer is late according to the scenario below, the current hirer may cancel the
                    booking and receive a full refund on his/her booking.

                    Duration of booking Minimum waiting time before full refund on cancellation
                    1 â€“ 2 hours 5 mins
                    3 â€“ 23 hours 15 mins
                    More than or equals to 24 hours 45 mins
                    For avoidance of doubt, the current Hirer will not be entitled to receive a share of the relevant
                    late fees (i.e. to be charged on the previous Hirer) if he opts to cancel and refund his booking.
                    The current Hirer will only be entitled to receive a share of the relevant late fees (i.e. to be
                    charged on the previous Hirer) if the current Hirer proceeds with his booking.

                    Hirer is responsible for ensuring their account with their private hirer service provider (e.g.
                    Grab) is updated. In the event of any discrepancies between the Hirer's account with Tribecar and
                    the Hirerâ€™s account with their private hirer service provider, Tribecar will at its best effort to
                    assist the Hirer, but Tribecar will not have any obligations to provide the Hirer any refunds.
                    Tribecar will at its best effort basis put up an online announcement or email Hirers to inform on
                    any changes to this Agreement and/or the terms and conditions for the use of the Website and
                    Services.
                    Tribecar will have the right to cancel any of the Hirer's booking/s for any of the following
                    reasons: (i) for any dispute with Tribecar relating to any pricing discrepancy; (ii) the Hirer
                    abusing the Tribecar Website and/or system; or (iii) the Hirer not complying with the terms and
                    conditions stated by Tribecar in this Agreement.
                    The up to date penalty fees and charges may be found in the FAQs of the website:
                    https://help.tribecar.com/
                    In the best interests of the community and the business, the Hirer hereby acknowledges and agrees
                    that Tribecar has the right to unilaterally cancel, or amend bookings, on behalf of the Hirer for
                    reasons other than set out in Clauses 4(h), 11(d) and 11(k), provided always that:-
                    Tribecar shall provide to the Hirer notification (e.g. email, SMS or call) at the earliest
                    opportunity notice of such cancellation and/or amendments to the Hirerâ€™s bookings; and
                    Tribecar shall reimburse the Hirer the full amount of the booking fees paid by the Hirer for the
                    relevant Rental Period in respect of (1) a booking cancelled by Tribecar in accordance with this
                    Clause 11(m), or (2) a booking amended by Tribecar in accordance with this Clause 11(m) which the
                    Hirer subsequently cancels at any time prior to the Rental Period. For the avoidance of doubt, the
                    reimbursement by the Tribecar under this Clause 11 (m)(ii) shall only be by way credits into his/her
                    e-wallet, and no reimbursement shall be paid in cash to the Hirer.
                    In light of Tribecarâ€™s right to cancel or amend the Hirerâ€™s bookings in accordance with this Clause
                    11(m), the Hirer hereby acknowledges and agrees that the onus shall be on the Hirer to check if
                    there are any cancellation or amendments to the Hirerâ€™s bookings within twenty-four (24) hours prior
                    to the relevant Rental Period. In the event that the Hirer does not wish to proceed with a booking
                    which has been amended by Tribecar in accordance with this Clause 11(m), such Hirer may cancel such
                    amended booking at any time prior to the start of the relevant Rental Period and the Hirer will be
                    entitled to a full reimbursement of the relevant booking fees to their e-wallet in accordance with
                    Clause 11(m)(ii). If the Hirer does not cancel such amended booking before the start of the relevant
                    Rental Period, the Hirer hereby acknowledges and agrees that he/she shall be deemed to have accepted
                    the amendment of the relevant booking by Tribecar and the Hirer will not be entitled to any
                    reimbursements for such booking amended by Tribecar.
                    The Hirerâ€™s account may be temporarily suspended pending the investigation of the potentially
                    deleterious actions by the Hirer. Including but not limited to Hirer's action such as entering
                    Malaysia without permission, unauthorised use of vehicle, abusing behaviour of Hirer towards staff

                    TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
                    Tribecar reserves the right to terminate the Agreement if the Hirer breaches any provisions in this
                    Agreement; or do or allow to be done any act or thing which in the opinion of Tribecar may
                    jeopardize Tribecar's rights to the Vehicle and the safety of the Vehicle, Tribecar's property and
                    staff, and the public.
                    In view of public safety and the safety of Tribecar's Vehicle, property and staff, if the Hirer has
                    12 or more demerit points (under the DIPS program by the Traffic Police), or if the hirer has been
                    blacklisted by other firms (affiliated or otherwise) for any reason whatsoever, Tribecar reserves
                    the right to terminate the Agreement.
                    For avoidance of doubt, if the e-Wallet is negative (i.e., the Hirer owes Tribecar payment), and if
                    the money owed is the same or more than the security deposit paid by the Hirer, Tribecar may first
                    deduct the amount owed by the Hirer from the security deposit and close the member's account and/or
                    terminate this agreement without notice.
                    Prior to the termination of this Agreement, the Hirer has to close his/her account by sending notice
                    to Tribecar. The Hirer has to do so by filling up the termination form and mailing it over to
                    Tribecar. All balances in the e-Wallet will not be returned and the Hirer are encouraged to exhaust
                    them first prior to the account closure.
                    If Tribecar exercises the right to terminate the Agreement, Tribecar will fully refund the Security
                    Deposit and the balance of his e-Wallet (including any future booking that will be refunded as
                    credit to the e-wallet first) to the hirer via a cheque or such other manner of payment which
                    Tribecar may reasonably decide at its absolute discretion. This refund only occurs if there is no
                    outstanding amount due to Tribecar and if Tribecar has no outstanding or ongoing unresolved issues
                    with the Hirer.
                    In exercising its right to terminate a Hirer's account, Tribecar may immediately suspend the account
                    of the Hirer and suspend all future bookings made by the Hirer. Tribecar will also send the hirer an
                    notification (via phone call/SMS/letter/email) of the suspension.
                    If the Hirer did not make any bookings prior to his account termination, Hirer will be charged an
                    administrative fee of S$5.40 from Hirer's deposit.
                    If the Hirerâ€™s age is outside of the stipulated permitted age range, his account will be
                    automatically suspended, all insurance coverage will be withdrawn and his or her account will be
                    terminated by Tribecar in accordance with Clause 12(e)
                    Upon the termination of this Agreement, the Hirer agrees to pay Tribecar
                    All arrears of the Rental and all other sums accrued and unpaid at the date of termination;
                    Cost of all repairs required at the date of termination;

                    MOTORCYCLE RENTAL
                    The Hirer and the Authorised Rider(s) MUST have a valid Class 2B/2A/2 License to be eligible for the
                    rental and use of the relevant class of Motorcycles which such Rider is permitted to ride pursuant
                    to the applicable license that he/she holds. For the avoidance of doubt, the Hirer acknowledges and
                    agrees that he/she and the Authorised Rider(s) shall not make any bookings with Tribecar for any
                    particular class of Motorcycle and/or ride any particular class of Motorcycle to which he/she does
                    not have the applicable license to ride.
                    Where applicable in this Agreement, for the purpose of this Clause 16, the terms "Driver", "Hirer"
                    may be used interchangeably with the term "Rider". Similarly, "Driving", "Operating" may be used
                    interchangeably with the term "Riding". Lastly, terms such as "Bike", "Scooter", "Vehicle" may be
                    used interchangeably with the term "Motorcycle". In cases where the terms are unclear, Tribecar
                    shall have sole discretion in the final determination on the usage of these terms.
                    Petrol policy for Motorcycles differs from petrol policy for cars. The Rider must fill up with
                    petrol that is grade RON 95 or higher and return the Motorcycle with a full tank of petrol at the
                    end of each booking before the conclusion of the Rental Period.
                    Motorcycle helmet (or safety headgear), gloves, or such other rider's safety apparel will not be
                    provided with the booking. The Rider shall be required to bring along his/her own safety equipment.
                    The Rider will not be able to start the Motorcycle once the trip is ended. For safety reasons, the
                    Rider is advised not to use the End Trip function while on the move or when the Motorcycle is away
                    from the designated parking.
                    The Rider is responsible for checking the conditions of the Chain and the Sprocket of the motorcycle
                    (if applicable to the model) before riding the motorcycle. If the motorbike breakdown due to the
                    chain comes loose or breaks during the rental, the Rider shall be responsible for the cost of tow
                    and all repair costs (including Sprocket replacement if applicable). There shall be two trips for
                    the tow, one from the breakdown point to the appointed workshop and another from the appointed
                    workshop back to the designed parking location.
                    All the motorcycles are equipped with an IU, as required by the government. This IU is constantly
                    powered and drains the battery within the motorcycle. It is the responsibility of the Rider to
                    run/ride the bike for at least 20 mins every 3 days to ensure the battery within the motorcycle does
                    not drain completely which damages the motorcycle.
                    The insurance policy for Motorcycles provides for commercial usage. The Rider may use the
                    Motorcycles for deliveries and/or logistics services but NOT for the provision of passenger-carrying
                    service. E.g., HonestBee / Deliveroo / NTUC / RedMart / PizzaHut / McDonalds / Road Bull / Riverwood
                    / GrabFood / Go-jek (Logistics/Services), etc but not Grab / Go-Gek (passenger carrying).
                    The insurance coverage for Motorcycles is as follows:
                    Own Damage Excess per Accident

                    The stated insurance excess only applies to authorised Riders with a valid Class 2B/2A/2 driving
                    licence (based on passed date of the relevant riding class's Traffic Police riding test or the
                    issuance of licence by Traffic Police for the relevant riding class, whichever is more recent).
                    To the extent that is permitted by the law, for the purpose of accident/insurance claims, the Rider
                    and his/her pillion shall be treated as one party (i.e. 1st party) as they are related parties. For
                    avoidance of doubt, the pillion is not treated as a 3rd party in any accident/insurance claims.
                    The Rider shall not take on passengers (pillion or otherwise) for reward or hire.
                    The stated insurance excess excludes loss of use for downtime of the Motorcycle.
                    Motorcycles have significantly shorter service mileage than cars and are typically between 1,000km
                    to 2,000 km per service. It is not uncommon to come near or cross the servicing mileage during a
                    Hirer's booking. The Hirer agrees to bring the motorcycle to Tribecar's authorised workshops before
                    the motorcycle exceeds 200 km in mileage from the servicing mileage as indicated in your booking
                    email or on the sticker found under the motorcycle seat. The servicing takes about 15 minutes and
                    the Hirer will be reimbursed with 1-day of rental to the Hirer's booking. The Hirer may be liable
                    for repair costs if he or she fails to service the bike in time and there is damage to the
                    motorcycle.

                    when the vehicle is stationary while on level ground. If Hirer does otherwise, then they shall be

                    area.
                    Pickup Trucks (such as Mitsubishi L200 Double-cab) may not be used by Engineering or Surveying Firms
                    (or by those in service of these firms or purposes). If the Hirer does so without permission, any
                    additional wear and tear and grooming required will be charged towards said hirer. Special
                    authorisation by Tribecar is required if the vehicle is to be used by said prohibited firms and
                    purposes.
                    For certain classes of vehicles, e.g. Fiat Doblo, Nissan NV100, etc, there are cargo dividers/seats
                    installed in the rear cargo area. There is no insurance coverage for the cargo or individual(s)
                    using those spaces. If purchased or added, the Personal Accident Insurance option shall solely apply
                    to the driver of the vehicle. The Hirer indemnifies Tribecar against all losses, claims,
                    compensation, direct or indirect from the use of the space/cargo dividers and seats in the rear
                    cargo area.
                    To the maximum extent that is permitted by the law, for the purpose of accident/insurance claims,
                    the Hirer and his/her passenger(s) shall be treated as one party (i.e. 1st party) as they are
                    related parties. For avoidance of doubt, the passenger(s) is/are not treated as a 3rd party in any
                    accident/insurance claims.

                    FUEL INCLUDED RENTALS
                    Car Club by Tribecar category Vehicles have fuel included in the reservation and Hirers are charged
                    based on the reservation period (time-based) and the fuel used (distance-based mileage). As of 7
                    July 2023 1200 Hours, the mileage fee is at SGD $0.39 for every kilometer travelled for Car Club
                    Select Category and SGD $0.49 for every kilometer traveled for Car Club Prime Category.

                    The Hirer is only allowed to use the fleet card provided in the Car Club by Tribecar Category
                    vehicles only when the hirer has a booking for this category and only for the booked / reserved
                    vehicle. Any use other than for refueling the booked Car Club by Tribecar category Vehicles is
                    considered misuse.

                    The Hirer will not be required to pay for fuel top-up at fuel stations as Tribecar provides prepaid
                    petrol cards in the reserved vehicle. In the event that the Hirer is required to make a pre-payment
                    for fuel, the Hirer will be responsible to provide the fuel top-up receipt to Tribecar for
                    verification before the reimbursement is processed.

                    Upon retrieval of Car Club by Tribecar Category Vehicles from fuel stations, the Hirer is
                    responsible to ensure the barricade is placed back at the vehicle lots to ensure no other vehicles
                    are parked at the reserved lots. If the barricades are found to be misplaced or damaged, the hirer
                    will be subjected to a penalty based on damage excess.

                    The Hirer may be requested to perform an authorisation hold on their credit card (proportionate to
                    the length of their booking) for the purpose of prepayment of mileage charges. The Hirer may also be
                    requested to make payment for the mileage charges that have accrued during their booking, before the
                    end of their booking.

                    Tribecar reserves the right to terminate the reservation/booking or the account of the Hirer, and/or
                    to recover the Vehicle, before the end of their reservation/booking to recover mileage charges
                    accrued during the lapsed periods of the reservation/booking.

                    TRIBESHIELD
                    TribeShield is a motor excess rider that provides the Hirer the ability to claim reimbursement on
                    the motor excess that they have paid during an accident in a Tribecar Vehicle. It does not decrease
                    the rental excess liability of the Hirer. The Hirer must always pay for the stated rental excess
                    described in this Terms and Conditions.
                    TribeShield provides for the Hirer to claim up to limits stated in the accident excess table above
                    but subject to a minimum charge of $540.00 per section of rental excess. The claim may be less than
                    the maximum allowed but the Hirer must always pay $540.00 per section of rental excess in an
                    accident.
                    TribeShield is applicable for purchase by all Tribecar Hirers including New Drivers.
                    TribeShield is only applicable for the following scenarios
                    An accident happens, primary insurance is involved and pay-out is required,
                    any other scenarios as approved by Tribecar.
                    Other than the approved scenarios above, TribeShield is not applicable to minor damages costing
                    below the rental excess payable OR incidents not involving the primary insurance.
                    Hirer must select and pay for TribeShield before the collection of the Vehicle in order to be
                    enrolled under TribeShield. The hirer is also responsible to check that the TribeShield add-on has
                    been purchased successfully on Tribecar's system. Tribecar will not entertain claims where the Hirer
                    claims that the addon was purchased but the addon was not recorded in the system.
                    In an event of an accident where the Hirer would like to make a claim for this policy, the Hirer
                    must inform Tribecar of this intention to file this claim during accident reporting by written
                    medium such as email. The Hirer must also go to Tribecarâ€™s appointed workshop for accident
                    reporting. GIA report with full rental excess payment must be made before Hirer is eligible for the
                    claim. The claim may be denied or subject to Tribecar's approval if there is a late filing.
                    The Hirer must include with their claim the following documents - GIA Report, receipt of excess
                    payment made to workshop, screenshot of booking details, workshop invoice showing damage accessed
                    and amount, NRIC and driver license, coloured photo of damaged AND repaired car, TribeShield claims
                    form and insurance discharge voucher if they are claiming against the third party. The list is not
                    exhaustive and is subject to Tribecar's advisory given during Hirer's claim.
                    Tribecar, vehicle owner, workshop, and its affiliates will do their best to provide details and
                    documentation and facilitate the claim process but a successful claim is subject to final approval.
                    In the event that the claim is unsuccessful for any reason, not limited to documentation being
                    complete, the aforementioned parties will not be held liable.
                    If there is an intention to commit fraud under this claim, Hirer may be prosecuted under the penal
                    code and be charged with an administrative and processing fee of 20 times the claim amount by
                    Tribecar. Hirers are strongly warned against colluding with any party, including the Vehicle Owner,
                    to make false claims. If fraud is suspected, claims will be rejected by Tribecar.
                    Tribecar management reserves the right to make changes to TribeShield without any prior notice.
                    Any violation of the traffic or criminal act, not limited to drink driving or speeding, are grounds
                    for rejecting a claim under TribeShield.
                    Hirer must ensure all information provided is accurate and Hirer fully discloses all important facts
                    of the accident in order to submit for this claim. The claim will be rejected if Hirer withheld
                    information or provided inaccurate information regarding the accident.
                    The disbursement for successful claims under this addon is determined solely by Tribecar. It
                    typically follows the disbursement time frame of the primary insurance policy. This time frame is
                    not controlled by Tribecar and Tribecar does not have control of the successful disbursement time
                    frame.
                    Hirer is binded and agrees to the full policy wording of the motor excess rider addon provided by
                    Tribecar.
                    In case of disputes arising out of or in connection with these terms, Tribecar reserves the right of
                    final decision.

                    attractions/package destinations are made accurately at least 24 hours in advance to secure the
                    preferred date/time for their visit.
                    Tribecar shall not be held responsible or liable if any preferred date and timeslot had been fully
                    booked on the website of the attraction/package destination. Hirers are to ensure that they have
                    checked the availability before making the purchase for the bundle add-on.
                    Terms for Malaysia use in Clause 15 shall remain in place for any TribeTravels Malaysia-related

                    The attractions/package destinations/third-party service providers have the right to accept or
                    reject the attraction tickets or package confirmation if found to have been acquired through
                    unauthorised means.
                    Attraction tickets sold and confirmed packages are non-refundable, non-exchangeable and

                    before proceeding to make payment.
                    Depending on the terms and conditions of each attraction, any pre-booked date of visit may or may
                    not be amended if holders of the attraction tickets are unable to visit on the selected date. Hirers
                    understand that amendments (if allowed) may require reaching out to the attractions directly.
                    Any request for amendment depends on the availability and may require further charges depending on
                    the nature of the changes required (e.g. number of rooms, change in room categories, etc.)
                    Prices stated on the platform may be subjected to changes due to the revision of prices by the
                    attractions/package destinations/third-party service providers. Tribecar reserves the right to amend
                    these prices without notice.
                    The terms and conditions, as well as the different steps to use or redeem the tickets, vary for each
                    attraction/package. More information can be found in the details for each attraction/package during
                    booking, or in the ticket/package confirmation email once the booking has been confirmed.
                    If hirers are found to use the attraction tickets/package confirmation in ways that are against the
                    law, Tribecar and the respective attractions/package destinations/third-party service providers
                    reserve the right to cancel the transaction without refund.
                    Any additional personal information collected from hirers will solely be used for the purpose of

                    destinations, whenever required.
                    Hirers acknowledge and agree that they are solely responsible for the accuracy and content of any
                    personal information provided to Tribecar, for usage in booking and payment processes. Tribecar
                    shall not be held responsible or liable for any unsuccessful bookings resulting from any inaccurate
                    or incomplete information provided by the hirer.

                    attractions/package destinations/third-party service providers.
                    There may be links to other sites from the attraction/package details provided by third-party
                    service providers. Tribecar does not have control over the information in these links and hence
                    shall not be held responsible or liable for them.
                    Hirers shall contact the respective attractions/package destinations directly for enquiries or
                    feedback relating to the attraction/package destinations itself.
                    The management reserves the right to make the final decision should dispute arise, or amend the
